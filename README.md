2.152 Term Paper: *Robust Adaptive Control of Planar Quadrotor with Unknown Parameters*

This is a (relatively disorganized) repository holding all simulation, results, and write-up of my term paper from the nonlinear control course (2.152) at MIT.

**TODO**: Extend parameter estimate feedback for full integration with outer-loop kinodynamic motion planning loop with KRRT*

**TODO**: Investigate ways to extend to higher-dimensional nonlinear systems
